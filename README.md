# AB_Testing_Facebook_Biddings

Facebook introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing

"maximum bidding" type. One of the companies which use the recent bidding type has decided to test this new feature and wants

to conduct an A/B test to determine if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding. 

For the company, the success metric is 'Purchase'.
