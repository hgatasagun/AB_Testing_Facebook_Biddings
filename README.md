![Açıklama](https://github.com/hgatasagun/AB_Testing_Facebook_Biddings/blob/main/AB_test.jpg)



Facebook introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" type. In this study, the statistical significance of any differences in the number of product purchases made by customers after clicking on ads will be examined, based on the utilization of these bidding methods.



## Dataset Story

This dataset contains web analytics data for a company, including information about the number of ad impressions, ad clicks, and the revenue 
generated from those ads. There are two separate datasets: Control and Test groups. Maximum Bidding was applied to the Control group, while 
Average Bidding was applied to the Test group.




### Variables:

Impression: Number of ad impressions

Click: Number of clicks on the ads

Purchase: Number of product purchases after the clicks

Earning: Revenue generated from the purchases
