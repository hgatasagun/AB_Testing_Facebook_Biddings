Facebook introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing

"maximum bidding" type. One of the companies which use the recent bidding type has decided to test this new feature and wants

to conduct an A/B test to determine if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding. 

For the company, the success metric is 'Purchase'.



## Dataset Story

This dataset contains web analytics data for a company, including information about the number of ad impressions,

ad clicks, and the revenue generated from those ads. There are two separate datasets: Control and Test groups.

Maximum Bidding was applied to the Control group, while Average Bidding was applied to the Test group.



### Variables:

impression: Number of ad impressions

Click: Number of clicks on the ads

Purchase: Number of product purchases after the clicks

Earning: Revenue generated from the purchases
